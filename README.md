***Technical Analysis For Java***


**Important note:** _Ta4j was initially developed by Marc de Verdelhan [mdeverdelhan](https://github.com/mdeverdelhan). He decided to give up the project, since lack of time. See [#192](https://github.com/mdeverdelhan/ta4j/issues/192). Many, many thanks for this great work and he made it possible with his work and his time to provide us such a great solution ta4j.
So there was a decision to fork the project and to pull it below the top level organisation ta4j. Also the corresponding domain was registered and will be contributed to the ta4j organisation, which hopefully will evolve from the contributors._

* The new corresponding webpage http://ta4j.org will also be initialized in the near future.<br>

* **The maintenance of ta4j will be continued in a new repository: https://github.com/ta4j/ta4j**

This repository was only for a simple transition of the new team and will be dropped soon! So please:

**DO NOT post issues here**
**DO NOT push MR here**

**PLEASE USE https://github.com/ta4j/ta4j for any discussions, post, Wiki-Documentation or anything relevant**
